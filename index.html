      <p><strong>2012 Nationwide Floods (July-October)</strong>Nigeria recored 363 deaths, 
        around 2.1 million people displaced, and over 2,000 homes were destroyed. 
        Among the victims of this flood event were Christians in Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2022 Major Floods (May-October)</strong>Nigeria recorded around 612 deaths, about 1.4 million people displaced,
        over 200,000 homes destroyed, alongside a cholera outbreak that claimed 64 additional lives.
        Among these victims were Christians in Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2024 Flood Events</strong>Across many states in Nigeria, including dam collapse in Borno, over 1,200 lives were lost.
        Around 1.2 million people were displaced, while schools, hospitals, and farmlands were destroyed.
        Among the victims of this flood event were Christians in Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2025 Mokwa Flood (May)</strong>151 deaths were recorded, and over 3,000 people were displaced. 
        Among the victims of this Flood were also Christians.
      </p>
      <h5><em>This is how vulnerable Nigeria has been to global climate crisis...</em></h5>
      <p>You care so much about Christians in Nigeria, yet you withdrew from the Paris Agreement,
        despite being among the top emitters of GHGs, 
        leaving developing countries like Nigeria more vulnerable to rising global temperatures — a
        reality you are fully aware of.
      </p>
      <p>At the end of the day it is simply a zero-sum game and power politics — a tool of foreign policy,
        not necessarily a reflection of genuine humanitarian care.
